netsed - network packet stream editor

netsed proto lport rhost rport rule1 [rule2] ...

NetSED is small and handful utility designed to alter the contents of packets forwarded thru your network in real time. It is really useful for network hackers in following applications:

black-box protocol auditing
    whenever there are two or more propertiary boxes communicating over undocumented protocol (by enforcing changes in ongoing transmissions, you will be able to test if tested application is secure)
fuzz-alike experiments, integrity tests
    whenever you want to test stability of the application and see how it ensures data integrity,
other common applications
    fooling other people, content filtering, etc etc - choose whatever you want to.

It perfectly fits netgrep, netcat and tcpdump tools suite :P
OPTIONS

proto
    protocol specification (tcp or udp)
lport
    local port to listen on (see README for transparent traffic intercepting on some systems)
rhost
    where connection should be forwarded (0 = use destination address of incoming connection, see README)
rport
    destination port (0 = dst port of incoming connection)
ruleN
    replacement rules (see below)

General replacement rules syntax: s/pat1/pat2[/expire]

This will replace all occurences of pat1 with pat2 in matching packets. Additional parameter (count) can be used to expire rule after 'count' succesful substitutions. Eight-bit characters, including NULL and '/', can be passed using HTTP-alike hex escape sequences (eg. %0a%0d). Single '%' can be reached by using '%%'. Examples:

's/andrew/mike/1'
    replace 'andrew' with 'mike' (once)
's/andrew/mike'
    replace all occurences of 'andrew' with 'mike'
's/andrew/mike%00'
    replace 'andrew' with 'mike\x00\x00' (to keep orig. size)
's/%%/%2f/20'
    replace '%' with '/' in first 20 packets

Rules are not working on cross-packet boundaries and are evaluated from first to last not expired rule.
