NAME
       lscpu - display information on CPU architecture

SYNOPSIS
       lscpu [-hpx] [-s directory]

DESCRIPTION
       lscpu gathers CPU architecture information like number of CPUs, threads, cores, sockets, NUMA nodes, information about
       CPU caches, CPU family, model, bogoMIPS, byte order and stepping from sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo,  and  prints  it  in  a
       human-readable format.  It supports both online and offline CPUs.  It can also print out in a parsable format, includ‚Äê
       ing how different caches are shared by different CPUs, which can be fed to other programs.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a help message.

       -p, --parse [=list]
              Print out in parsable instead of human-readable format.

              If the list argument is not given then the default backwardly compatible output  is  printed.   The  backwardly
              compatible  format  uses  two  commas  to separate CPU cache columns. If no CPU caches are identified, then the
              cache columns are not printed at all.

              The list argument is comma delimited list of the columns. Currently supported are CPU, Core, Node, Socket, Book
              and  Cache  columns. If the list argument is given then always all requested columns are printed in the defined
              order. The Cache columns are separated by ':'.

              Note that the optional list argument cannot be separated from the option by a space, the correct  form  is  for
              example '-p=cpu,node' or '--parse=cpu,node'.

       -s, --sysroot directory
              Use the specified directory as system root.  This allows you to inspect a snapshot from a different system.

       -x, --hex
              Use hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (e.g. 0x3).  The default is to print the sets in list format (e.g. 0,1).

BUGS
       The basic overview about CPU family, model, etc. is always based on the first CPU only.

       Sometimes in Xen Dom0 the kernel reports wrong data.
