NAME
       jstack - Stack Trace


SYNOPSIS
       jstack [ option ] pid
       jstack [ option ] executable core
       jstack [ option ] [server-id@]remote-hostname-or-IP


PARAMETERS
       Options are mutually exclusive. Option, if used, should follow immediately after the command name. See OPTIONS.

          pid
             process id for which the stack trace is to be printed. The process must be a Java process. To get a list of Java
             processes running on a machine, jps may be used.


          executable
             Java executable from which the core dump was produced.

          core
             core file for which the stack trace is to be printed.

          remote-hostname-or-IP
             remote debug server's (see jsadebugd) hostname or IP address.

          server-id
             optional unique id, if multiple debug servers are running on the same remote host.


DESCRIPTION
       jstack prints Java stack traces of Java threads for a given Java process or core file or a remote  debug  server.  For
       each Java frame, the full class name, method name, 'bci' (byte code index) and line number, if available, are printed.
       With the -m option, jstack prints both Java and native frames of all threads along with the  'pc'  (program  counter).
       For  each  native frame, the closest native symbol to 'pc', if available, is printed. C++ mangled names are not deman‚Äê
       gled. To demangle C++ names, the output of this command may be piped to c++filt. If the given process is running on  a
       64-bit VM, you may need to specify the -J-d64 option, e.g.:


          jstack -J-d64 -m pid


       NOTE  -  This  utility  is unsupported and may or may not be available in future versions of the JDK. The only form of
       jstack that is available on Windows platforms is

           jstack pid


OPTIONS
          -F Forces a stack dump when 'jstack pid' does not respond.

          -m prints mixed mode (both Java and native C/C++ frames) stack trace.

          -h prints a help message.

          -help
             prints a help message

KNOWN BUGS
       Mixed mode stack trace, the -m option, does not work with the remote debug server.
