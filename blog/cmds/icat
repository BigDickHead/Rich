ICAT(1)                                                                                                               ICAT(1)



NAME
       icat - Output the contents of a file based on its inode number.

SYNOPSIS
       icat [-hrsvV] [-f fstype ] [-i imgtype ] [-o imgoffset ] [-b dev_sector_size] image [images] inode

DESCRIPTION
       icat opens the named image(s) and copies the file with the specified inode number to standard output.


ARGUMENTS
       -f fstype
              Specifies  the file system type.  Use '-f list' to list the supported file system types.  If not given, autode‚Äê
              tection methods are used.

       -h     Skip over holes in sparse files, so that absolute address information is lost. This  option  saves  space  when
              copying sparse files.

       -r     Use file recovery techniques if the file is deleted.

       -s     Include the slack space in the output.

       -i imgtype
              Identify  the  type  of  image  file, such as raw or split.  Use '-i list' to list the supported types.  If not
              given, autodetection methods are used.

       -o imgoffset
              The sector offset where the file system starts in the image.

       -b dev_sector_size
              The size, in bytes, of the underlying device sectors.  If not given, the value in the image format is used  (if
              it exists) or 512-bytes is assumed.

       -v     Enable verbose mode, output to stderr.

       -V     Display version

       image [images]
              One (or more if split) disk or partition images whose format is given with '-i'.

       inode  Inode number. icat concatenates the contents of all specified files.
