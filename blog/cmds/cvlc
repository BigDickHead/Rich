SYNOPSIS
       vlc [OPTIONS] [ITEMS]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the VLC multimedia player and server.


OPTIONS
       VLC follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  For a precise
       description of options, please use "vlc --help".

       The complete list of VLC options depends on what plugins are installed because they automatically add their own
       options. Please use "vlc --longhelp --advanced" for a complete list of available options.

       *.mpg, *.vob, *.avi, *.mp3, *.ogg
