DESCRIPTION:
rinetd redirects TCP connections from one IP address and port to another, no support for UDP. rinetd is a single process server which handles any number of connections to the address/port pairs specified in the file /etc/rinetd.conf. Since rinetd run as a single process using nonblocking I/O, it is able to redirect a large number of connections without a server impact on the machine. This makes it practical to run TCP services on machine inside an IP masquerading firewall. rinetd does not redirect FTP, because FTP requires more than one socket.
