maskprocessor:~

    Generates dictionaries based on patterns you supply.~

    Not a password cracker in its own right, but can pipe output to oclHashcat-plus for a brute-force attack. 

hashcat:~

    *CPU-based* so slower than the GPU-based software.

    Supports the widest range of hashing algorithms. 

oclHashcat:~

    *GPU-based* password cracker.

    Supports a moderate number of hashing algorithms.

    Built-in support for dictionary, brute-force and mask attacks. 

oclHashcat-plus:~

    *GPU-based*

    Supports the most hashing algorithms of the GPU-based hashcat crackers.

    Optimized for dictionary attacks against multiple hashes.

    Can support dictionary input from a pipe, so brute-force is possible. 

oclHashcat-lite:~

    *GPU-based*

    Optimized for attacks against a single password hash.

    Fastest of the hashcat family, but with the most-limited password hash support.
