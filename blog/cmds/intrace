InTrace is a traceroute-like application that enables users to enumerate IP hops exploiting existing TCP connections, both initiated from local network (local system) or from remote hosts. It could be useful for network reconnaissance and firewall bypassing. 


Usage: intrace <-h hostname> [-p <port>] [-d <debuglevel>] [-s <payloadsize>] [-6]
