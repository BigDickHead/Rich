Usage:  dump_fmap [-x] [-p|-f|-h] FLASHIMAGE [NAME...]

Display (and extract with -x) the FMAP components from a BIOS image.
The -p option makes the output easier to parse by scripts.
The -f option emits the FMAP in the format used by flashrom.

Specify one or more NAMEs to only print sections that exactly match.

The -h option shows the whole FMAP in human-readable form.
  Use -H to also display any gaps.
