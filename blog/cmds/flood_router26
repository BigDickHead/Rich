Syntax: flood_router26 [-HFD] [-s] [-RPA] interface

Flood the local network with router advertisements.
Each packet contains 17 prefix and route enries
-F/-D/-H add fragment/destination/hopbyhop header to bypass RA guard security.
-R does only send routing entries, no prefix information.
-P does only send prefix information, no routing entries.
-A is like -P but implements an attack by George Kargiotakis to disable privacy extensions
The option -s uses small lifetimes, resulting in a more devasting impact
