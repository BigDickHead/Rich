NAME
       Axel - A light download accelerator for Linux.


SYNOPSIS
       axel [OPTIONS] url1 [url2] [url...]


DESCRIPTION
       Axel  is  a  program  that  downloads  a file from a FTP or HTTP server
       through multiple connection, each connection downloads its own part  of
       the file.

       Unlike most other programs, Axel downloads all the data directly to the
       destination file, using one single thread. It just saves some  time  at
       the  end  because the program doesn't have to concatenate all the down‐
       loaded parts.


OPTIONS
       One argument is required, the URL to the file  you  want  to  download.
       When  downloading  from FTP, the filename may contain wildcards and the
       program will try to resolve the full filename. Multiple  URL's  can  be
       specified  as  well  and  the  program will use all those URL's for the
       download. Please note that the program does not check whether the files
       are equal.


       Other options:


       --max-speed=x, -s x
              You  can  specify  a speed (bytes per second) here and Axel will
              try to keep the average speed around this speed. Useful  if  you
              don't want the program to suck up all of your bandwidth.


       --num-connections=x, -n x
              You can specify an alternative number of connections here.


       --output=x, -o x
              Downloaded  data will be put in a local file with the same name,
              unless you specify a different name using this option.  You  can
              specify  a  directory as well, the program will append the file‐
              name.


       --search[=x], -S[x]
              Axel can do a search for  mirrors  using  the  filesearching.com
              search  engine. This search will be done if you use this option.
              You can specify how many different mirrors should  be  used  for
              the download as well.

              The search for mirrors can be time-consuming because the program
              tests every server's speed, and it  checks  whether  the  file's
              still available.


       --no-proxy, -N
              Don't  use  any  proxy server to download the file. Not possible
              when a transparent proxy is active somewhere, of course.


       --verbose
              If you want to see  more  status  messages,  you  can  use  this
              option. Use it more than once if you want to see more.


       --quiet, -q
              No output to stdout.


       --alternate, -a
              This  will  show an alternate progress indicator. A bar displays
              the progress and status of the  different  threads,  along  with
              current speed and an estimate for the remaining download time.


       --header=x, -H x
              Add an additional HTTP header. This option should be in the form
              "Header: Value". See RFC 2616 section 4.2 and 14 for details  on
              the format and standardized headers.


       --user-agent=x, -U x
              Set  the  HTTP  user agent to use. Some websites serve different
              content based  upon  this  parameter.  The  default  value  will
              include "Axel", its version and the platform.


       --help, -h
              A brief summary of all the options.


       --version, -V
              Get version information.


NOTE
       Long  (double  dash)  options are supported only if your platform knows
       about the getopt_long call. If it does not (like *BSD), only the  short
       options can be used.


RETURN VALUE
       The  program  returns 0 when the download was succesful, 1 if something
       really went wrong and 2 if the download was interrupted.  If  something
       else comes back, it must be a bug..


EXAMPLES
       axel ftp://ftp.{be,nl,uk,de}.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.17.tar.bz2

       This will use the Belgian, Dutch, English and German kernel.org mirrors
       to download a Linux 2.4.17 kernel image.

       axel -S4 ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.17.tar.bz2

       This will do a search for the linux-2.4.17.tar.bz2 file on  filesearch‐
       ing.com  and  it'll  use the four (if possible) fastest mirrors for the
       download.  (Possibly including ftp.kernel.org)

       (Of course, the commands are a single line, but they're too long to fit
       on one line in this page.)


FILES
       /etc/axelrc  System-wide configuration file. Note that development ver‐
       sions place this file in /usr/local/etc.

       ~/.axelrc Personal configuration file

       These files are not documented in a  man-page,  but  the  example  file
       which  comes  with the program contains enough information, I hope. The
       position of the system-wide configuration file might be different.
