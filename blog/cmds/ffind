NAME
       ffind - Finds the name of the file or directory using a given inode

SYNOPSIS
       ffind [-aduvV] [-f fstype] [-i imgtype] [-o imgoffset] [-b dev_sector_size] image inode

DESCRIPTION
       ffind  finds  the  names  of files or directories that are allocated to inode on disk image image.  By default it only
       will only return the first name it finds.  With some file systems, this will find deleted file names.


ARGUMENTS
       image [images]
              One (or more if split) disk or partition images whose format is given with '-i'.

       inode  Integer of inode to find.

              The optional arguments are:

       -a     Find all occurrences of inode.

       -d     Find deleted entries only.

       -f fstype
              Identify the file system type of the image.  Use '-f list' to list the supported file  system  types.   If  not
              given, autodetection methods are used.

       -u     Find undeleted entries only.

       -i imgtype
              Identify  the  type  of  image  file, such as raw or split.  Use '-i list' to list the supported types.  If not
              given, autodetection methods are used.

       -o imgoffset
              The sector offset where the file system starts in the image.

       -b dev_sector_size
              The size, in bytes, of the underlying device sectors.  If not given, the value in the image format is used  (if
              it exists) or 512-bytes is assumed.

       -v     Verbose output to stderr.

       -V     Display version.


       This  program searches all directory entries looking for the given inode.  This is useful when an inode has been iden‚Äê
       tified from a disk unit address using ifind(1).


EXAMPLE
       # ffind -a image 212
