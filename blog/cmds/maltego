The unique perspective that Maltego offers to both network and resource based entities is the aggregation of information posted all over the internet - whether it’s the current configuration of a router poised on the edge of your network or the current whereabouts of your Vice President on his international visits, Maltego can locate, aggregate and visualize this information.
