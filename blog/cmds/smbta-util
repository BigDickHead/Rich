NAME
       smbta-util - control encryption in VFS smb_traffic_analyzer

SYNOPSIS
       smbta-util

       smbta-util [COMMANDS...]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(1) suite.

       smbta-util is a tool to ease the configuration of the vfs_smb_traffic_analyzer module regarding data encryption.

       The user can generate a key, install a key (activating encryption), or uninstall a key (deactivating encryption). Any
       operation that installs a key will create a File containing the key. This file can be used by smbta-tool on other
       machines to install the same key from the file.

COMMANDS
       -h
           Show a short help text on the command line.

       -f KEYFILE
           Open an existing keyfile, read the key from the file, and install the key, activating encryption.

       -g KEYFILE
           Generate a new random key, install the key, activate encryption, and store the key into the file KEYFILE.

       -u
           Uninstall the key, deactivating encryption.

       -s
           Check if a key is installed.
