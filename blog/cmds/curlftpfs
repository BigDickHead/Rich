CurlFtpFS - A FTP filesystem based on cURL and FUSE

Description

CurlFtpFS is a filesystem for accessing FTP hosts based on FUSE and libcurl.


CurlFtpFS differentiates itself from other FTP filesystems because it features:

    SSLv3 and TLSv1 support
    connecting through tunneling HTTP proxies
    automatically reconnection if the server times out
    transform absolute symlinks to point back into the ftp file system


Examples

Using CurlFtpFS is quite simple. Take a look at this example:

$ mkdir sunet
$ curlftpfs ftp://ftp.sunet.se/ sunet/
$ cd sunet/
$ ls -l
total 0
Dr-xr-xr-x   3 root root        96 Feb 23  2004 bin
dr-xr-xr-x   2 root root        72 Mar  2  2004 dev
dr-xr-xr-x   2 root root        48 Feb 23  2004 etc
dr-xr-xr-x   2 root root       120 Feb 23  2004 lib
-rw-r--r--   1 root root 622187310 Mar 11 06:13 ls-lR
-rw-r--r--   1 root root  76389037 Mar 11 06:15 ls-lR.gz
drwxrwxr-x  37 root root      1272 Feb 27 14:17 pub
dr-xr-xr-x   3 root root        72 Feb 23  2004 usr
$ cd ..
$ fusermount -u sunet/
or umount sunet/

Can use curlftpfs to mount ftp server in network.
curlftpfs -o codepage=utf8 ftp://username:password@192.168.192.168 /ftp


    How do I specify a user name and password?
    There are two ways. First using the url, as in ftp://user:pass@site.com/. The second is using the option -o user, as in -o user="user:pass".
    How can I prevent the password from showing in the process list?
      

    How can I make CurlFtpFS mount automatically at startup?
    You can add it to /etc/fstab. Example:

      curlftpfs#ftp.host.com /mnt/host fuse rw,uid=500,user,noauto 0 0
      

    My FTP server puts me in my home dir. How do I mount the root directory?
    Just use as many ".." as necessary. Example:

      curlftpfs ftp://ftp.myserver.com/../../.. /mnt/ftp
