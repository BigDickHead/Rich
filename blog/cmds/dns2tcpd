NAME
       dns2tcpd - A tunneling tool that encapsulate TCP traffic over DNS.


SYNOPSIS
       dns2tcpd [ -h ] [ -F ] [ -i address ] [ -f config_file ] [ -p pidfile ] [ -d debug_level ]


DESCRIPTION
       dns2tcp  is  a network tool used to encapsulate TCP communications in DNS. When connections are received on a specific
       port all TCP traffic is sent to the remote dns2tcpd server and forwarded to a specific host and port. Multiple connec‚Äê
       tions are supported.


       It was written for demonstration purposes

       -h     Help Menu

       -F     Run in foreground

              Change debug level. Levels available are 1, 2 or 3.


CONFIGURATION FILES
       By  default  ${HOME}/.dns2tcprcd  is  used  if  no  configuration file is specified. The resource syntax is <resource-
       name>:<server>:<port>. Multiple resources can be defined in multilines, but must be comma separated.

       Here is an example :

              listen = 127.0.0.1
              port = 53
              user = nobody
              chroot = /tmp
              pid_file = /var/run/dns2tcp.pid
              domain = dns2tcp.hsc.fr
              debug_level = 0
              resources = ssh:127.0.0.1:22 , smtp:127.0.0.1:25,
                           pop3:10.0.0.1:110
