netdiscover - an active/passive arp reconnaissance tool.

netdiscover -r 192.168.1.1/24

Usage: netdiscover [-i device] [-r range | -l file | -p] [-s time] [-n node] [-c count] [-f] [-d] [-S] [-P] [-C]
  -i device: your network device
  -r range: scan a given range instead of auto scan. 192.168.6.0/24,/16,/8
  -l file: scan the list of ranges contained into the given file
  -p passive mode: do not send anything, only sniff
  -F filter: Customize pcap filter expression (default: "arp")
  -s time: time to sleep between each arp request (miliseconds)
  -n node: last ip octet used for scanning (from 2 to 253)
  -c count: number of times to send each arp reques (for nets with packet loss)
  -f enable fastmode scan, saves a lot of time, recommended for auto
  -d ignore home config files for autoscan and fast mode
  -S enable sleep time supression betwen each request (hardcore mode)
  -P print results in a format suitable for parsing by another program
  -L in parsable output mode (-P), continue listening after the active scan is completed

If -r, -l or -p are not enabled, netdiscover will scan for common lan addresses.




SYNOPSIS
       netdiscover [-i device] [-r range | -l file | -p] [-s time] [-n node] [-c count] [-f] [-d] [-S] [-P] [-L]

DESCRIPTION
       netdiscover  is  an active/passive arp reconnaissance tool, initialy developed to gain information about wireless net‐
       works without dhcp servers in wardriving scenarios. It can also be used on switched networks. Built on top  of  libnet
       and libpcap, it can passively detect online hosts or search for them by sending arp requests.

       Furthermore,  it  can  be  used to inspect your network's arp traffic, or find network addresses using auto scan mode,
       which will scan for common local networks.

OPTIONS
       -i device
              The network interface to sniff and inject packets. If no interface is specified, first available will be used.


       -r range
              Scan a given range instead of auto scan. Valid range values area for example: 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.0.0/16 or
              192.168.0.0/8.


       -l file
              Scan ranges contained on the given file, it must contain one range per line.


       -p     Enable passive mode. In passive mode, netdiscover does not send anything, but does only sniff.


       -s time
              Sleep given time in milliseconds between each arp request injection. (default 1)


       -c count
              Number of times to send each arp request. Useful for networks with packet loss, so it will scan given times for
              each host.


       -n node
              Last ip octet of the source ip used for scanning. You can change it  if  the  default  host  is  already  used.
              (allowed range: 2 to 253, default 66)


       -S     Enable  sleep  time  suppression  between each request. If set, netdiscover will sleep after having scanned 255
              hosts instead of sleeping after each one.  This mode was used in netdiscover 0.3 beta4 and before.  Avoid  this
              option in networks with packet loss, or in wireless networks with low signal level. (also called hardcore mode)


       -f     Enable  fast  mode  scan. This will only scan for .1, .100 and .254 on each network. This mode is usefull while
              searching for ranges being used.  After you found such range you can make a specific range scan to find  online
              boxes.


       -d     Ignore  configuration  files at home dir, this will use defaults ranges and ips for autoscan and fast mode. See
              below for information about configuration files.


       -P     Produces output suitable to be redirected into a file or be parsed by another program, instead of using  inter‐
              active mode. Enabling this option, netdiscover will stop after scanning given ranges.


       -L     When using -P, continue program execution after the active scan phase to capture ARP packets passively.


USAGE
       If  passive  mode  (-p), scan list (-l) or scan range (-r) options arent enabled, netdiscover will scan for common lan
       addresses.

CONFIG FILES
       There are 2 configuration files that netdiscover will look for, each time it is executed, if file doesnt exist it will
       use default values. You can use the -d switch to disable reading and loading configuration files.


       ~/.netdiscover/ranges
              This  file  contains  a  list  of  ranges  (one per line) used for auto scan mode instead of default ranges. By
              default netdiscover will use a list of common ranges used on local networks.

              Example:
               192.168.21.0/24
               172.26.0.0/16
               10.0.0.0/8


       ~/.netdiscover/fastips
              List contaning the last octect of the ips to be scanned on each  subnet,  when  using  fast  mode,  by  default
              (1,100,154).

              Example:
               1
               10
               25
               254
