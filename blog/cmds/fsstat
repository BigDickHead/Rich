NAME
       fsstat - Display general details of a file system

SYNOPSIS
       fsstat [-f fstype ] [-i imgtype] [-o imgoffset] [-b dev_sector_size] [-tvV] image [images]

DESCRIPTION
       fsstat  displays the details associated with a file system.  The output of this command is file system specific.  At a
       minimum, the range of meta-data values (inode numbers) and content units (blocks or clusters) are given.   Also  given
       are  details  from  the Super Block, such as mount times and and features.   For file systems that use groups (FFS and
       EXT2FS), the layout of each group is listed.

       For a FAT file system, the FAT table is displayed in a condensed format.  Note that the data is in sectors and not  in
       clusters.


ARGUMENTS
       -t type
              Print the file system type only.

       -f fstype
              Specify the file system type.  Use '-f list' to list the supported file system types.  If not given, autodetec‚Äê
              tion methods are used.

       -i imgtype
              Identify the type of image file, such as raw or split.  Use '-i list' to list  the  supported  types.   If  not
              given, autodetection methods are used.

       -o imgoffset
              The sector offset where the file system starts in the image.

       -b dev_sector_size
              The  size, in bytes, of the underlying device sectors.  If not given, the value in the image format is used (if
              it exists) or 512-bytes is assumed.

       -v     Verbose output of debugging statements to stderr

       -V     Display version

       image [images]
              One (or more if split) disk or partition images whose format is given with '-i'.
