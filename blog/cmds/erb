NAME
       erb - an embedded Ruby language interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       erb1.9.1 [switches] [inputfile]

DESCRIPTION
       erb  interprets  a  Ruby code embedded text file. For example, erb enables you to embed a Ruby code to a HTML file.  A
       Ruby block starts with `<%' and ends with `%>'. erb replaces the block with its output.  If `<%' is followed  by  `=',
       eRuby replaces the block with a value of the block.  If `<%' is followed by `#', the block is ignored as a comment.
