BOMBARDMENT(1)                                     bombardment v2.70                                    BOMBARDMENT(1)



NAME
       bombardment - Run Siege with an ever-increasing number of users

SYNOPSIS
       bombardment [urlfile] [initial number of clients] [increment value] [number of increments] [delay]"
       bombardment urlfile.txt 5 10 20 1

DESCRIPTION
       bombardment  is  part  of  the Siege package.  It calls siege with an initial number of clients.  When that run
       finishes, it immediately calls siege again with that number of clients plus the increment.  It  does  this  the
       number of times specified in the fourth argument.

OPTIONS
       urlfile
              The name of the file containing one or more URLs for siege to test.

       initial number of clients
              The number of clients to be used on the first Siege run.

       increment value
              The number of clients to add from run to run.

       number of increments
              The number of times to run siege.

       delay  The  is  the amount of time, in seconds, that each client will wait between requests.  The Siege default
              of 3 is overridden by bombardment and is 15.

NOTES
       bombardment can very easily overcome process and filehandle limits.  Siege DOES give a warning if it  is  going
       to  exceed  600  concurrent processes.  See your system documentation (or try ulimit -a) for information on the
       limits of your system before using a high number of concurrent users.
