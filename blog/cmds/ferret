options:
 -i <adapter>    Sniffs the wire(less) attached to that network adapter. 
                 Must have libpcap or winpcap installed to work.
 -r <files>      Read files in off-line mode. Can use wildcards, such as 
                 using "ferret -r *.pcap". Doesn't need libpcap to work.
 -c <file>       Reads in more advanced parameters from a file.
