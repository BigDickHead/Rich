NAME
       unpack200 - JAR Unpacking tool

SYNOPSIS
       unpack200 [ options ] input-file JAR-file

       Options may be in any order. The last option on the command line supersedes all previously specified options.

          input-file
             Name  of  the  input  file, which can be a pack200 gzip file or a pack200 file. The input could also be JAR file
             produced by pack200(1) with an effort of 0. In this case the contents of the input file will be  copied  to  the
             output JAR file with the Pack200 marker.

          JAR-file
             Name of the output JAR file.

DESCRIPTION
       unpack200  is  a  native  implementation that transforms a packed file produced by pack200(1) into a JAR file. Typical
       usage:

          % unpack200 myarchive.pack.gz myarchive.jar

       In this example, the myarchive.jar is produced from myarchive.pack.gz using the default unpack200 settings.

OPTIONS
   Standard Options
       -Hvalue --deflate-hint=value

          Sets the deflation to be true, false, or keep on all entries within a JAR file. The default mode is keep.  If  true
          or false, overrides the default behavior and sets the deflation mode on all entries within the output JAR file.

   Non-Standard Options
       -r --remove-pack-file

          Removes the input packed file.

       -v --verbose

          Outputs minimal messages. Multiple specification of this option will output more verbose messages.

       -q --quiet

          Specifies quiet operation with no messages.

       -lfilename --log-file=filename

          Specifies a log file to output messages.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

           0 if successful completion;

          >0 if an error occurred.
