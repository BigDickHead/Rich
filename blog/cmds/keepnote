NAME
       keepnote - cross-platform note-taking and organization application

SYNOPSIS
       keepnote [ options ] [ notebook ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the keepnote commands.

       keepnote  is  a  note  taking  application. With KeepNote, you can store your class notes, TODO lists, research notes,
       journal entries, paper outlines, etc in a simple notebook hierarchy with rich-text formatting, images, and more. Using
       full-text search, you can retrieve any note for later reference.

       KeepNote  is  designed to be cross-platform (implemented in Python and PyGTK) and stores your notes in simple and easy
       to manipulate file formats (HTML and XML). Archiving and transferring your notes is as easy as zipping  or  copying  a
       folder.
