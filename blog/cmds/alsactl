NAME
       alsactl - advanced controls for ALSA soundcard driver


SYNOPSIS
       alsactl [options] [store|restore|init] <card # or id or device>


DESCRIPTION
       alsactl  is  used  to  control advanced settings for the ALSA soundcard
       drivers. It supports multiple soundcards. If  your  card  has  features
       that  you can't seem to control from a mixer application, you have come
       to the right place.


COMMANDS
       store saves the current driver state for the selected soundcard to  the
       configuration file.

       restore loads driver state for the selected soundcard from the configu‐
       ration file. If restoring fails (eventually partly), the init action is
       called.

       init  tries  to initialize all devices to a default state. If device is
       not known, error code 99 is returned.

       If no soundcards are specified, setup for all cards will  be  saved  or
       loaded.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show available flags and commands.


       -d, --debug
              Use debug mode: a bit more verbose.


       -v, --version
              Print alsactl version number.


       -f, --file
              Select   the   configuration   file   to  use.  The  default  is
              /var/lib/alsa/asound.state.


       -F, --force
              Used with restore command.  Try to restore the matching  control
              elements  as  much  as  possible.  This option is set as default
              now.


       -g, --ignore
              Used with store and restore commands. Do not show 'No soundcards
              found' and do not set an error exit code when soundcards are not
              installed.


       -P, --pedantic
              Used with restore command.  Don't  restore  mismatching  control
              elements.  This option was the old default behavior.


       -I, --no-init-fallback
              Don't  initialize cards if restore fails.  Since version 1.0.18,
              alsactl tries to initialize the card with the restore  operation
              as  default.   But this can cause incompatibility with the older
              version.  The caller may expect that the state won't be  touched
              if no state file exists.  This option takes the restore behavior
              back to the older version by suppressing the initialization.


       -r, --runstate
              Save restore and init state to this file. The file will  contain
              only  errors.   Errors are appended with the soundcard id to the
              end of file.


       -R, --remove
              Remove runstate file at first.


       -E, --env #=#
              Set environment variable (useful for  init  action  or  you  may
              override ALSA_CONFIG_PATH to read different or optimized config‐
              uration - may be useful for "boot" scripts).


       -i, --initfile #=#
              The   configuration   file   for   init.   By   default,    PRE‐
              FIX/share/alsa/init/00main is used.


FILES
       /var/lib/alsa/asound.state  (or  whatever  file you specify with the -f
       flag) is used to store current settings for your soundcards.  The  set‐
       tings  include  all  the  usual  soundcard mixer settings.  More impor‐
       tantly, alsactl is capable of controlling other card-specific  features
       that mixer apps usually don't know about.

       The  configuration  file  is generated automatically by running alsactl
       store. Editing the configuration file by hand may be necessary for some
       soundcard features (e.g. enabling/disabling automatic mic gain, digital
       output, joystick/game ports, some future MIDI routing options, etc).
