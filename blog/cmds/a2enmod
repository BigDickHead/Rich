NAME
       a2enmod, a2dismod - enable or disable an apache2 module

SYNOPSIS
       a2enmod [module]

       a2dismod [module]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the a2enmod and a2dismod commands.

       a2enmod is a script that enables the specified module within the apache2 configuration.  It does this by creating sym‐
       links within /etc/apache2/mods-enabled.  Likewise, a2dismod disables a module by removing those symlinks.  It  is  not
       an error to enable a module which is already enabled, or to disable one which is already disabled.

       Note that many modules have, in addition to a .load file, an associated .conf file.  Enabling the module puts the con‐
       figuration directives in the .conf file as directives into the main server context of apache2

EXAMPLES
              a2enmod imagemap
              a2dismod mime_magic

       Enables the mod_imagemap module, and disables the mod_mime_magic module.

FILES
       /etc/apache2/mods-available
              Directory with files giving information on available modules.

       /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
              Directory with links to the files in mods-available for enabled modules.

SEE ALSO
       apache2ctl(8).
