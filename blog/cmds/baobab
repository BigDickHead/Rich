NAME
       Baobab - A graphical tool to analyse disk usage

SYNOPSIS
       baobab  [directory]

DESCRIPTION
       baobab is able to scan either specific folders or the whole filesystem (local and remote), in order to give the user a
       graphical tree representation including each directory size or percentage in the branch.  It also auto-detects in
       real-time any change made to your home directory as far as any mounted/unmounted device. A graphical treemap window is
       also provided for any selected folder.

       A detailed documentation on the program could be read at: http://www.gnome.org/projects/baobab
