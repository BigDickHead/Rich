NAME
       locale-gen — generates localisation files from templates

SYNOPSIS
       locale-gen

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the locale-gen command.

       By  default,  the locale package which provides the base support for localisation of libc-based programs does not con‐
       tain usable localisation files for every supported language. This limitation has became necessary because of the  sub‐
       stantial  size  of  such files and the large number of languages supported by libc. As a result, Debian uses a special
       mechanism where we prepare the actual localisation files on the target host and  distribute  only  the  templates  for
       them.

       locale-gen  is  a  program  that reads the file /etc/locale.gen and invokes localedef for the chosen localisation pro‐
       files.  Run locale-gen after you have modified the /etc/locale.gen file.



FILES
       /etc/locale.gen

       The main configuration file, which has a simple format: every line that is not empty and does not begin with  a  #  is
       treated as a locale definition that is to be built.


SEE ALSO
       localedef(1), locale(1), locale.gen(5).
