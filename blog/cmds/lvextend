DESCRIPTION
       lvextend allows you to extend the size of a logical volume.  Extension of snapshot logical  volumes  (see  lvcreate(8)
       for  information  to create snapshots) is supported as well.  But to change the number of copies in a mirrored logical
       volume use lvconvert(8).

OPTIONS
       See lvm for common options.

       --noudevsync
              Disable udev synchronisation. The process will not wait for notification from udev.  It will continue irrespec‐
              tive of any possible udev processing in the background.  You should only use this if udev is not running or has
              rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.

       -l, --extents [+]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}]
              Extend or set the logical volume size in units of logical extents.  With the + sign the value is added  to  the
              actual  size  of the logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an absolute one.  The number can also
              be expressed as a percentage of the total space in the Volume Group with the suffix %VG, relative to the exist‐
              ing  size of the Logical Volume with the suffix %LV, of the remaining free space for the specified PhysicalVol‐
              ume(s) with the suffix %PVS, as a percentage of the remaining free space in the Volume Group  with  the  suffix
              %FREE,  or  (for  a  snapshot)  as a percentage of the total space in the Origin Logical Volume with the suffix
              %ORIGIN.  The resulting value is rounded upward.

       -L, --size [+]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE]
              Extend or set the logical volume size in units of megabytes.  A size suffix of M for  megabytes,  G  for  giga‐
              bytes,  T  for terabytes, P for petabytes or E for exabytes is optional.  With the + sign the value is added to
              the actual size of the logical volume and without it, the value is taken as an absolute one.

       -i, --stripes Stripes
              Gives the number of stripes for the extension.  Not applicable to LVs using the original metadata  LVM  format,
              which must use a single value throughout.

       -I, --stripesize StripeSize
              Gives  the  number  of  kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes.  Not applicable to LVs using the original
              metadata LVM format, which must use a single value throughout.
              StripeSize must be 2^n (n = 2 to 9)

       -f, --force
              Proceed with size extension without prompting.

       -n, --nofsck
              Do not perform fsck before extending filesystem when filesystem requires it. You may need  to  use  --force  to
              proceed with this option.

       -r, --resizefs
              Resize underlying filesystem together with the logical volume using fsadm(8).

Examples
       "lvextend  -L +54 /dev/vg01/lvol10 /dev/sdk3" tries to extend the size of that logical volume by 54MB on physical vol‐
       ume /dev/sdk3.  This is only possible if /dev/sdk3 is a member of volume group vg01 and there are enough free physical
       extents in it.

       "lvextend  /dev/vg01/lvol01  /dev/sdk3" tries to extend the size of that logical volume by the amount of free space on
       physical volume /dev/sdk3.  This is equivalent to specifying "-l +100%PVS" on the command line.

       "lvextend -L+16M vg01/lvol01 /dev/sda:8-9 /dev/sdb:8-9"
       tries to extend a logical volume "vg01/lvol01" by 16MB using physical extents /dev/sda:8-9 and /dev/sdb:8-9 for  allo‐
       cation of extents.
