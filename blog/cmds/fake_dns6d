Syntax: fake_dns6d interface ipv6-address [fake-ipv6-address [fake-mac]]
Fake DNS server that serves the same ipv6 address to any lookup request
You can use this together with parasite6 if clients have a fixed DNS server
Note: very simple server. Does not honor multiple queries in a packet, norNS, MX, etc. lookups.
