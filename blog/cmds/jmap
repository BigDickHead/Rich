NAME
       jmap - Memory Map

SYNOPSIS
       jmap [ option ] pid
       jmap [ option ] executable core
       jmap [ option ] [server-id@]remote-hostname-or-IP


PARAMETERS
       option
          Options are mutually exclusive. Option, if used, should follow immediately after the command name.

       pid
          process  id  for  which  the memory map is to be printed. The process must be a Java process. To get a list of Java
          processes running on a machine, jps may be used.

       executable
          Java executable from which the core dump was produced.

       core
          core file for which the memory map is to be printed.

       remote-hostname-or-IP
          remote debug server's (see jsadebugd) hostname or IP address.

       server-id
          optional unique id, if multiple debug servers are running on the same remote host.


DESCRIPTION
       jmap prints shared object memory maps or heap memory details of a given process or core file or a remote debug server.
       If the given process is running on a 64-bit VM, you may need to specify the -J-d64 option, e.g.:

          jmap -J-d64 -heap pid


       NOTE - This utility is unsupported and may or may not be available in future versions of the JDK.


       The only forms of jmap available on the Windows platform are


          jmap -dump:<dump-options> pid
       and


          jmap -histo[:live] pid

OPTIONS
       <no
          option>  When no option is used jmap prints shared object mappings. For each shared object loaded in the target VM,
          start address, the size of the mapping, and the full path of the shared object file are printed. This is similar to
          the Solaris pmap utility.

       -dump:[live,]format=b,file=<filename>
          Dumps the Java heap in hprof binary format to filename. The live suboption is optional. If specified, only the live
          objects in the heap are dumped. To browse the heap dump, you can use jhat (Java Heap Analysis  Tool)  to  read  the
          generated file.

       -finalizerinfo
          Prints information on objects awaiting finalization.

       -heap
          Prints a heap summary. GC algorithm used, heap configuration and generation wise heap usage are printed.

       -histo[:live]
          Prints  a  histogram of the heap. For each Java class, number of objects, memory size in bytes, and fully qualified
          class names are printed. VM internal class names are printed with '*' prefix. If the live suboption  is  specified,
          only live objects are counted.

       -permstat
          Prints  class  loader  wise statistics of permanent generation of Java heap. For each class loader, its name, live‚Äê
          ness, address, parent class loader, and the number and size of classes it has loaded are printed. In addition,  the
          number and size of interned Strings are printed.

       -F Force.  Use  with jmap -dump or jmap -histo option if the pid does not respond. The live suboption is not supported
          in this mode.

       -h Prints a help message.

       -help
          Prints a help message.

       -J<flag>
          Passes <flag> to the Java virtual machine on which jmap is run.
