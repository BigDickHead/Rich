BUGS
       ldd does not work on a.out shared libraries.

       ldd does not work with some extremely old a.out programs which were built before ldd support was added to the compiler
       releases.  If you use ldd on one of these programs, the program will attempt to run with argc = 0 and the results will
       be unpredictable.
