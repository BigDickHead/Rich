DESCRIPTION
       lvdisplay allows you to see the attributes of a logical volume like size, read/write status, snapshot information etc.

       lvs  (8)  is an alternative that provides the same information in the style of ps (1).  lvs is recommended over lvdis‐
       play.


OPTIONS
       See lvm for common options and lvs for options given with --columns.

       --all  Include information in the output about internal Logical Volumes that  are  components  of  normally-accessible
              Logical  Volumes,  such as mirrors, but which are not independently accessible (e.g. not mountable).  For exam‐
              ple, after creating a mirror using 'lvcreate -m1 --mirrorlog disk', this option will reveal three internal Log‐
              ical Volumes, with suffixes mimage_0, mimage_1, and mlog.

       -c, --colon
              Generate  colon separated output for easier parsing in scripts or programs.  N.B. lvs (8) provides considerably
              more control over the output.

              The values are:

              * logical volume name
              * volume group name
              * logical volume access
              * logical volume status
              * internal logical volume number
              * open count of logical volume
              * logical volume size in sectors
              * current logical extents associated to logical volume
              * allocated logical extents of logical volume
              * allocation policy of logical volume
              * read ahead sectors of logical volume
              * major device number of logical volume
              * minor device number of logical volume


       -m, --maps
              Display the mapping of logical extents to physical volumes and physical extents.  To map  physical  extents  to
              logical extents use  pvs --segments -o+lv_name,seg_start_pe,segtype.

       --columns | -C
              Display output in columns, the equivalent of lvs.  Options listed are the same as options given in lvs (8).

Examples
       "lvdisplay -v /dev/vg00/lvol2" shows attributes of that logical volume.  If snapshot logical volumes have been created
       for this original logical volume, this command shows a list of all snapshot logical volumes and their  status  (active
       or inactive) as well.

       "lvdisplay  /dev/vg00/snapshot"  shows  the attributes of this snapshot logical volume and also which original logical
       volume it is associated with.
