Usage:  dev_make_keypair BASENAME [ALG]

This creates BASENAME.vbpubk and BASENAME.vbprivk pairs for use in signing
developer files. This also creates a BASENAME.keyblock file containing the
BASENAME.vbpubk, which can be used to sign a developer kernel.

If specified, ALG is one of:

  0    =  RSA1024 with SHA1
  1    =  RSA1024 with SHA256
  2    =  RSA1024 with SHA512
  3    =  RSA2048 with SHA1
  4    =  RSA2048 with SHA256
  5    =  RSA2048 with SHA512
  6    =  RSA4096 with SHA1
  7    =  RSA4096 with SHA256
  8    =  RSA4096 with SHA512
  9    =  RSA8192 with SHA1
  10   =  RSA8192 with SHA256
  11   =  RSA8192 with SHA512

If ALG is not specified, a default value will be used.
