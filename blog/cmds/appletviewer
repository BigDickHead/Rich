NAME
       appletviewer - The Java Applet Viewer

       The  appletviewer  command  allows  you to run applets outside of a web
       browser.

SYNOPSIS
       appletviewer [ options ] urls ...

DESCRIPTION
       The appletviewer command connects to the documents or resources  desig‐
       nated  by  urls and displays each applet referenced by the documents in
       its own window. Note: if the documents referred to by urls do not  ref‐
       erence  any  applets  with  the  OBJECT,  EMBED,  or  APPLET  tag, then
       appletviewer  does  nothing.  For  details  on  the  HTML   tags   that
       appletviewer supports, see AppletViewer Tags @
       http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/appletview‐
       ertags.html.

       Note: The appletviewer requires encoded URLs according to the escaping
       mechanism defined in RFC2396. Only encoded URLs are supported. However,
       file names must be unencoded, as specified in RFC2396.

OPTIONS
       -debug
          Starts the applet viewer in the Java debugger, jdb, thus allowing
          you to debug the applets in the document.

       -encoding    encoding name
          Specify the input HTML file encoding name.

       -Jjavaoption
          Passes through the string javaoption as a single argument to the
          Java interpreter which runs the appletviewer. The argument should
          not contain spaces. Multiple argument words must all begin with the
          prefix -J, which is stripped. This is useful for adjusting the com‐
          piler's execution environment or memory usage.
