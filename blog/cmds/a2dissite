NAME
       a2ensite, a2dissite - enable or disable an apache2 site / virtual host

SYNOPSIS
       a2ensite [site]

       a2dissite [site]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the a2ensite and a2dissite commands.

       a2ensite is a script that enables the specified site (which contains a <VirtualHost> block) within the apache2 config‚Äê
       uration.  It does this by creating symlinks within /etc/apache2/sites-enabled.  Likewise, a2dissite disables a site by
       removing  those  symlinks.   It  is not an error to enable a site which is already enabled, or to disable one which is
       already disabled.

       The default site is handled specially: The resulting symlink will be called 000-default in order to be loaded first.

EXAMPLES
              a2dissite default

       Disables the default site.

FILES
       /etc/apache2/sites-available
              Directory with files giving information on available sites.

       /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
              Directory with links to the files in sites-available for enabled sites.

SEE ALSO
       apache2ctl(8).
