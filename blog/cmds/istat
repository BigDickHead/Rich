NAME
       istat - Display details of a meta-data structure (i.e. inode)

SYNOPSIS
       istat  [-B  num  ]  [-f fstype ] [-i imgtype] [-o imgoffset] [-b dev_sector_size] [-vV] [-z zone ] [-s seconds ] image
       [images] inode

DESCRIPTION
       istat displays the uid, gid, mode, size, link number, modified , accessed, changed times, and all  the  disk  units  a
       structure has allocated.

       The options are as follows:

       -B num Display the addresses of num disk units.  Useful when the inode is unallocated with size 0, but still has block
              pointers.

       -f fstype
              Specify the file system type.  Use '-f list' to list the supported file system types.  If not given, autodetec‚Äê
              tion methods are used.

       -s seconds
              The  time  skew  of  the original system in seconds.  For example, if the original system was 100 seconds slow,
              this value would be -100.

       -i imgtype
              Identify the type of image file, such as raw or split.  Use '-i list' to list  the  supported  types.   If  not
              given, autodetection methods are used.

       -o imgoffset
              The sector offset where the file system starts in the image.

       -b dev_sector_size
              The  size, in bytes, of the underlying device sectors.  If not given, the value in the image format is used (if
              it exists) or 512-bytes is assumed.

       -v     Verbose output of debugging statements to stderr

       -V     Display version

       -z zone
              An ASCII string of the original system's time zone.  For example, EST5EDT or GMT.  These strings are defined by
              the operating system and may vary.  NOTE: This has changed since TCTUTILs.

       image [images]
              One (or more if split) disk or partition images whose format is given with '-i'.

       inode  Meta-data number to display stats on
