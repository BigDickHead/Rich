NAME
       florence - extensible and scalable virtual keyboard for GNOME

SYNOPSIS
       florence [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Florence is an extensible scalable virtual keyboard for GNOME. You need it if you can’t use a real hardware keyboard,
       for example because of injury, handicap, your keyboard is broken or because you use a tablet PC, but you must be able
       to use a pointing device (as a mouse, a trackball, a touchscreen or opengazer); If you can’t use a pointing device,
       there is gok, which can be used with just simple switches.

       Florence stays out of your way when you don’t need it: it appears on the screen only when you need it. A timer-based
       auto-click input method is available to help disabled people having difficulties to click. The ramble mode is another
       efficient input method that can help.

       Florence is primarily intended to be used with the GNOME desktop, although it can be used on any desktop environment
       by using the --no-gnome option.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Print help message and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print Florence version and exit.

       -c, --config
           Open configuration dialog.

       -d, --debug
           Launch Florence in verbose mode.

       -n, --no-gnome
           Use this option if you are not using the GNOME desktop environment. This will disable some GNOME specific
           features.

       -f , --focus[=WINDOW]
           With this option, any florence input will go to the selected window. The window argument is the name of the window
           (the one that most window managers put in the title bar). if the window argument is not provided, florence will
           select the last focused window. This option is useful for window managers that don’t support the "not focusable"
           hint and focus the keyboard window instead of the output one. It can also be useful if you want to input text to a
           window that is not focused. This option must be used for the keyboard to work in GDM.

       -u FILE, --use-config=FILE
           Use the configuration file provided instead of gconf. The configuration file is a key-value pair file with
           sections. An example of configuration file is provided at /usr/share/doc/florence/examples/florence.conf.
